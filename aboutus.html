    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a small, independent studio with a big mission: to create a mobile game that empowers players to make a real
    difference in the fight to protect our planet. Our game, Drop, is more than just entertainment—it's a way for players to
    actively participate in the repopulation of endangered flora and fauna, and the restoration of ecosystems around the
    world.
    
    Our passion for the environment drives everything we do. Through Drop, we aim to raise awareness about the urgent need
    for conservation while providing a fun, engaging platform for players to contribute. With every tree planted, every
    ocean cleaned, and every species saved, we’re bringing hope back to nature.
    
    Together with our community of players and our dedicated partners, we believe that even small actions can lead to big
    changes. Join us on this journey to help heal the planet, one ecosystem at a time.</p>
